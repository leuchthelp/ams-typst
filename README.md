# Usage

- Install [Typst](https://typst.app/) as a CLI either locally (see [repo](https://github.com/typst/)) or use the web app
- *(If installed locally)* Compile the document with `typst c main.typ`

This project inherits most of it's code from [@xkevios](https://github.com/xkevio) [ParCIO typst templates](https://github.com/xkevio/parcio-typst). Thanks a lot for the work done.

`ams-slides` ports the presentation (beamer) slides.\

TODO
`ams-report` is somewhat outdated (will be updated soon).
